### K-Means Clusterings
Objective: group the supermarket customer into coherent clusters based on three customer information - age, annual income and spending score. 

### Neural Network
to classify patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal (0), Disk Hernia (1) or Spondylolisthesis (2) from six biomechanical attributes (features) derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine:

1. pelvic incidence
2. pelvic tilt
3. lumbar lordosis angle
4. sacral slope
5. pelvic radius
6. grade of spondylolisthesis

### Principle Component Analysis
The objective is to develop a principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the data.

In this data, there are nine socio-economic and health factors including
1. Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births
2. Exports of goods and services per capita. Given as %age of the GDP per capita
3. Total health spending per capita. Given as %age of GDP per capita
4. Imports of goods and services per capita. Given as %age of the GDP per capita
5. Net income per person
6. The measurement of the annual growth rate of the Total GDP
7. The average number of years a new born child would live if the current mortality patterns are to remain the same
8. The number of children that would be born to each woman if the current age-fertility rates remain the same.
9. The GDP per capita. Calculated as the Total GDP divided by the total population.
